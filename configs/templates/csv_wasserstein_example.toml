# Template: run Wasserstein F-localization on your own 1D CSV dataset.

# 1) Copy this file somewhere (or keep it here) and edit `path` + `column`.
# 2) Adjust grids (`mu_grid` and `t_grid`) to cover your data.
# 3) Run:
#
#   julia --project=. scripts/run_experiment.jl --config configs/templates/csv_wasserstein_example.toml --outdir results
